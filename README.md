# Section 4 BattleTank
****


This is  an open-world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in Unreal 4. This game is modeled on the concepts and teachings from a course on Udemy, see [here] (https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse). This will bring you to the site in which you will be able to take a look at the first few videos of the overall course.

This game is used to enhance and strengthen fidelity while programming with c++. 

Thank you!
